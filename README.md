# AI_project: TD-learning

Harvard CS182 Final Project

Overview:

The goal of this project is to explore different TD-learning, including SARSA, Q-learning, Expected-SARSA and do some analysis and discussions on how to compare and contrast these 3 methods. We then ran a simulation on simple mazes and compare the performances to identify the strength and weaknesses of these different methods.

File Description:

- The file `gridworld.py` have all the helper functions to build the environment.
- The file `utils.py` have all the functions to run the simulations (including the methods to run the algorithm for SARSA, Q-learning, Expetected-SARSA, plotting functions, etc.)
- The notebook `Evaluate_Algorithm.ipynb` shows a demo of how to build the environment using our codes, visualize the environment, and run the algorithm for SARSA, Q-learning, Expetected-SARSA on it.
